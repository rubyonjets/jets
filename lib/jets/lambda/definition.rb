    # The get_type method works for controller and event classes.
    #
    # Usually able to get the type from the class name. Examples:
    #
    #   PostsController => controller
    #   CoolEvent => event
    #
    # However, for function types, we are not able to get the type for multiple of
    # reasons.  First, function types are allowed to be named with or without
    # _function.  Examples:
    #
    #   path => class => type
    #   app/functions/hello.rb => Hello => function
    #   app/functions/hello_function.rb => HelloFunction => function
    #
    # The second reason is that functions are not regular ruby classes. Instead they
    # are anonymous classes created with Class.new.  When classes are created with
    # Class.new the method_added hook has "" (blank string) as the self class name.
    # We add the class_type to the task later on as we are constructing the class
    # as part of the Class.new logic.
    #
    # For controller and event standard ruby classes though it can easily be
    # determinated as part of initialization. So we get the type for convenience then.
    #
    # For anonymous function classes, we just set to nil and will later fix in
    # FunctionConstructor.
