A Jets controller handles a web request and renders a response. Here's an example:

app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # renders Lambda Proxy structure compatible with API Gateway
    render json: {hello: "world", action: "index"}
  end

  def show
    id = params[:id] # params available
    # puts goes to the lambda logs
    puts event # raw lambda event available
    render json: {action: "show", id: id}
  end
end
```

Helper methods like `params` provide transparent access to the request parameters encoded in the API Gateway event.  The `render` method automatically adapts the response to the Lambda Proxy structure that API Gateway understands.

For each public method in your controller, Jets creates a distinct Lambda function:
