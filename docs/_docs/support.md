## Getting Help

If you're looking for support for Jets, here are some options:

* Read the [Jets Documentation](http://rubyonjets.com)
* If you have a question about using Jets, start a discussion on [Jets Community Forum](https://community.rubyonjets.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rubyonjets)
* Chat with Jets users &mdash; Join [the Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tongueroo/jets) or [our IRC channel on Freenode](irc:irc.freenode.net/rubyonjets)

The Jets community is small and growing.  There are some benefits with a smaller community as you’ll have a better chance of getting to know folks. So you’ll likely find other folks who are interested in Jets and just figuring things out here. Would love for community members to be helpful and point others in the right direction. We've all been there before and sometimes the littlest helpful tip goes a long way for others.
